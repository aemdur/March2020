Ongoing projects since July 7 2019

My repository includes: 

  - A stock analysis dashboard I created in Tableau viewable as Tableau .twbx or .pdf .
    - If you do not have access to Tableau software, it (or a similar version) can also be accessed on my Tableau.Public profile: https://public.tableau.com/profile/ari.emdur#!/

  - some samples of SQL and R code written and annotated towards the completion of my BI Certificate at UCSD Extension.

  - An Excel Spreadsheet of global COVID-19 cases updated on 3/5/2020 from John Hopkins University, pulled via R code composed by Rami Krispin.
